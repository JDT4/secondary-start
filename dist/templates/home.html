<!--Form and button
User enters postcode
Postcode is stringified or spaces removed NOT ENCODED
Postcode is used as the argument in the function (apiCouncil.getTPDatabyPostCode(postcode) that can be found in CouncilControl)
Button runs the function and takes you to the detail view
Possibly rather than running the function it just creates a var = postcde that is accessable to CouncilControl?
